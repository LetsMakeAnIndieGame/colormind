This is ColorMind, a quick, easy JavaScript plugin for web developers to make their website more accessible to colorblind users.  It not only changes ALL elements within a target on a webpage for colorblind users, but the same algorithm can simulate, for non-colorblind developers, what their website would look like if it were viewed by someone with Protanopia, Deutanopia, or Tritanopia.  

With just two lines of code, the developer has an overlay that allows the user of the site to change the website on the client side to be more easily viewed with colorblindness.  Options allow the developer to change the appearance of the overlay, the position of the overlay, and more.  

The algorithm analyzes all markup including the pixels of images, and changes them based on scientifically developed methodologies to simulate and fix colors for colorblind.  

Currently, the project is still in development and needs your help.  There is work for all experience levels:  

- Factoring out redundant code.
- Increasing compatibility with modern and old browsers
- Adding new options
- Cleaning up the code
- Developing for server side applications
- And more

Please feel free to use this code on your website, so long as you don't sell the code.  Otherwise, you're always welcome to contribute work towards the project.
